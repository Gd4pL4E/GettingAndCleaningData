####Getting and Cleanin Data: Course Project

You should find the following files in the repo: run_analysis.R, CodeBook.md and tidy_data.txt.

- run_analysis.R includes the full script from downloading the file, to making the complete dataset as well as the tidy dataset. It also includes comments about the scipt in short.
- CodeBook.md is the codebook for the scipt, and includes variables and units and a lot of explenation of what is going on.
- tidy_data.txt is the tidy data file that had to be created for the project. Likely you are here to grade this submission for Coursera, in which case this file is the same as the one attached to my submission
