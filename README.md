##Getting and Cleaning Data: Course Project
This repo is my submission for the course project for the Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning Data", part of the Data Science track by Johns Hopkins University.

###The assignment
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected. 

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

*For more information, see the codebook and the comments at the start of the script*

###The script and other files
You should find the following files in the repo: run_analysis.R, CodeBook.md and tidy_data.txt.

- run_analysis.R includes the full script from downloading the file, to making the complete dataset as well as the tidy dataset. It also includes comments about the scipt in short.
- CodeBook.md is the codebook for the scipt, and includes variables and units and a lot of explenation of what is going on.
- tidy_data.txt is the tidy data file that had to be created for the project. Likely you are here to grade this submission for Coursera, in which case this file is the same as the one attached to my submission
